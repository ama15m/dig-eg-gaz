PoSt Office Notice. —The continual increase in the demand for house-to-house delivery in Cairo and Alexandria renders it absolutely necessary that all persons in these towns desirous of such delivery shall have the number of the house and name of the street in which they live indicated on their correspon-dence. Should by any chance a street be unnamed, then the quarter of the town in which it is situated must be indicated, Attention to these instructions is imperative to avoid delay and errors in the delivery of correspondence.
British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and mer chants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the question of appointing suitable agents. As no foe is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers can obtain further particulars from our London office, 36, New Broad-street, which acts as agents to the Chamber.
THE COTTON WORM.
HOPEFUL OUTLOOK.
In a recent issue we pointed out that the measures which had been taken by the Ministry of the Interior for the destruction of the cotton worm had proved most effective, and we have now received further information from the Ministry which indicates that the hopes which we expressed of the August brood (which is as a rule the most extensive and destructive of the three broods,) being slight, are by no means unfounded. The information to which we refer is that the reports from the province of Menoufieh show that no new eggs or cotton worm have been found in Menouf Marksz since the 18th inst, in Chibin and Kouesna since the 19th inst, and in Tala only a small number has been found and these are confined to an area of two feddans. The cotton in the Menoufieh province is particularly fine this year, and owing to the precautions which have been enforced by the Ministry of the Interior, no damage to the cotton crops has been sustained.
The Ministry of the Interior has issued the following note
“With reference to the note on this subject issued by the Ministry on the 1st July, 1905, it has been found that in certain districts cultivators have not understood that every effort must be directed towards the destruction of the Aphis or small green fly as soon as it appears. As explained in the circular, the suction of this fly does not actually destroy the leaves, though undoubtedly its action tends to enfeeble them, but, as they feed, they deposit a sticky kind of honey. This sticky substance in due coarse attracts the spores of a sooty fungus which is carried on the wind and settles wherever it is found. Many cultivators say, with reason, that the "Nedwet El Assal” comes later, but it must be clearly understood that, so far, when the “Nedwa” comes it has been found impossible to deal with it. The only thing to do is to destroy the “aphis" whenever it appears by spraying, if hand pumps are available, otherwise by picking and burning the leaves, or even when necessary by uprooting a certain number of plants. Any leaves on which the sticky substance is found must also be picked and burned, so that when the "Nedwa” comes now or later, there may be nothing to attract it and it will pass by. All this is set forth in the original circular, but as confusion still appears to exist in the minds of many cultivators, it is of (he greatest importance that immediate steps should bo taken to explain to all concerned. The “aphis” and the "assal" have already been detected in many localities, and in certain districts where there have lately been heavy mists in the early morning, the “Nedwa" has descended upon the affected leaves and the plants turn black and die. Urge the cultivators to search for the "aphis" and the "assal" When the “Nedwa” oomes it is too late,"
The following naw credits have been opened :—L.E. 2,000 for the improvement of the streets of Luxor, LE. 20,000 for the new prison to be constructed near the Delta Barrage, LE. 5,000 for the enlargement of the Abu Zaabal prison, L.E. 29,500 for the construc-tion of a barracks at Ras el Tin, L.E. 20,000 for new irrigation works in the Fayoum, and L.E. 11,400 for the enlargement of the Lunatic Asylum at Abbassieh.
PORT SAID’S TRADE.
WINE IMPORTS.
Port Said only plays a small part in the import trade in wines. The prices usual at Port Said are as follows for cases 12 bottles each f.o.b. Port Said : light sherry 15 frs., Manganilla 20 frs., Amontillado 22 frs., Madeira 19 frs., Malaga 17 from The red table wines imported from France arrive as a rule in barrels containing from 200 to 220 litres, with an average price of 30 frs. the hectolitre franco Marseilles. The white and red wines of Palestine are getting more and more into favor and are delivered at 33 centimes the litre. The excellent wines produced by the Jewish Colony of Richon-le-Zion are successfully competing-despite their higher price— with the Italian wines—Brindisi, Bari, Trani, Barletta, etc.—which usually cost from 20 to 30 fra. f.o.b. Port Said. Greek wines are sold by the kilo at from 16 to 18 centimes per kilo. Were the freights lower the cheaper Austrian table wines would be able to compete with a good chance of success, but as freight charges from Marseilles to Port Said only amount to 10 frs. per cubic metre, while those on the Austria Lloyd boats are double as high, it is not likely that they can be profitably imported. Hungarian wines, however, are likely to gain some ground in Alexandria and Cairo.

TURKISH PRISON LIFE.
AN INCIDENT AT BEYROUT.
(From a Correspondent.)
Last week a riot took plaoe in the prison at Beyrout which was a flagrant instance of looseness of control. Halim Zreik, a famous Christian outlaw who has ended in jail, seems to have boon promised by a body of Moslem prisoners a bribe of £50, to be paid him after the accomplishment of a murderous deed on another Christian prisoner, a certain Iskandar Nims, to avenge one of their co-religionists who had been murdered by the latter. Zreik attempted to murder Nima by two sudden stabs with a dagger, which brought the victim to the ground with two dangerous wounds in the shoulder.
The act caused a fanatical outbreak among the Christian and Moslem prisoners, which was not 
 until the tardy interferes of the police, who, having imperfectly disarmed the rioters,—oh 1 the irony of things in Turkey—gave occasion for a recru-descence of the same trouble on the following day. The incident, though followed by no very serious consequences, shows the dangerous unsoundness of the base on which rests the institution that is supposed to safeguard public safety and order.
If you pass by the prison at Beyrout you hear sounds of merriment and laughter, which show that the inmates are not only bearing prison-life lightly but are in a way enjoying it. In fact, the relatives of prisoners are allowed to bring to the latter food and every kind of delicacy, while inside the prison card-playing and music are allowed as freely as they would be in a cafe. The post of jailer is a lucrative one, for it is at the same time that of a caterer to the enjoyment of the prisoners in his charge. Indeed, his profits accrue not only from acts of active service, but also from connivance at irregularities committed. Imprisonment under these conditions becomes an attraction, especially to vagabonds and born idlers, and that is why imprisonment in Turkey defeats its end in a certain measure.
One would have thought that the cellular prisons in Cyprus, with all the perfections of new methods, would have served as an object-lesson and a model for Turkish penal institutions, but such unfortunately has not been the case. The corruption in Turkish prisons is appalling, and the contrast between the latter and modern European prison-houses is painful to all who care to see Turkey improve and prosper. Turkish prisons are simply halls of convivial pleasures catered to by venal indulgence, and they must seem strange abodes for the punishment of crime to those who know something of European cellular prisons, where vigilant severity makes life to the prisoner, as it should, a dreadful burden.
Penal institutions are the safeguards of public safety and order, and affect indirectly a nation’s peace, and it is therefore devoutly to be hoped that adequate attention will be paid by the authorities to the existing evil in Turkish prisons.
DAR FUR.
It is reported that Ali Dinar, Sultan of Dar Fur, has been engaged in hostilities against the Massalit, a savage negroid tribe whose territories lie between Kebkebieh and the Sultanate of Wadai. Another branch of this people inhabits Wadai and is said to be under Senoussi influence. The Massalit played a considerable part in the campaign of 1881-2 against Slatin Pasha, and later joined the “false Mahdi,” Abou Gemaizeh, himself of Massalit origin, and were very severely defeated by the Dervishes under Osman Wad Adam at El Fasher in 1889.

NOTES FROM THE SUDAN.
RAINS AND CROPS.
( From our Correspondent ).
Khartoum, July S3.
Though heavy rains have fallen early this year in the Southern Sudan, the Nile has risen very slowly compared with last season. The cultivators have already begun sowing (without ploughing, as they do not know how to do this) their fields of maize, and hope to have a very good crop. They have greatly suffered during the past four years owing to the scarcity of rain.
STARVING NATIVES.
The ardeb of dura is worth at present P.T. 120, and it will probably within three months fall to P.T. 30. This fall in price will prove a great boon to the already half-starved population of some parts of the interior of the Sudan, as I understand that a great many people have been eating the roots of the trees in the forests.
SALES OF LAND.
The scarcity of rain has also led numerous landowners to dispose of their lands at a very low price to the Greek merchants settling in the larger towns. The Government, realising the great harm which the peasants were causing to their own future welfare, have issued a proclamation to the effect that no land is to be sold without the special approval of the governors of the provinces concerned.
THE WILY GREEK.
It has come to my knowledge that the factor which led these merchants to acquire large areas of land is the prospect of the proposed canal to be built next year through the Ghezireh, i.e., the land lying between the Blue and White Niles. The Government are to be congratulated on having taken such a wise course, as I feel sure that had they not done so all the land would have passed into the hands of strangers, and the natives would have been left poor and miserable.
VISITATION OF LOCUSTS.
Myriads of locusts have passed over Ghe-zireh on their way South, but they are causing little or no anxiety, as no crop is grown at the present time of the year, and their eggs, when deposited, will be destroyed by the rains.
PERSONAL AND SOCIAL.
Prince Hussein Pasha and Prince Ibrahim Pasha Fonad have arrived at Alexandria from Cairo.
Mr. F. G. Morgan, the United States Vice-Consul General at Cairo, has ordered a20 horse-power Renault automobile in Paris. This will be fitted with Kellner-Dorsay body, painted out-side blue with thin turquoise stripes, and will be used by Mr. Morgan as a city vehicle in Cairo.
El Lewa E. Mansfield Pasha, Commandant of the Cairo City Police, will resume duty on October 30.
Mr. Tottenham, who arrived at Cairo on Sunday, is leaving almost immediately for the Sudan, where he will replace Mr. Dupuis during the latter's absence on leave.
Mr. H. Carter Wilson, director of Personnel and Accounts Dept., has returned from leave and resumed duty at the Ministry of the Interior.
Mr. E. W. Wortabet, whose services were lent to the Ministry of the Interior for cotton-worm duty by the Imperial Ottoman Bank, has been struck off the list of the temporary employes of the Ministry, his work being completed. He resumed duty at the Ottoman Bank to-day.	
Leave has been granted to Mr. M. Macdonald, director of the Assouan Barrage, for three months, to date from the 5th inst

Claes II. Course 0.
Thoee sailing in Class II., Course O., are requested to note that owing to an extension being made to the breakwater, when they are coming in from the Boghas beacon to Gabbary they must keep well clear of the breakwater lighthouse and leave on the port hand a buoy to the S.W. of the same which will have a mark boat with flag attached to it Yachts leaving this mark boat on the starboard hand and passing between it and the breakwater lighthouse will be disqualified, besides running the risk, if they are deep-draught boats, of grounding. 
In Class I., as the Minnie and Coot "tied" last month on points for the monthly prize and their relative handicap this week is the same, the first one of these two in to-morrow's race will win last month's prize irrespective of the cup being sailed for.
Saturday’s. Gymkhana attracted but a small number of people to the A. S. C. grounds, and the enclosure bore almost a deserted appearance. This is not to be wondered at when we consider how many are absent in Europe, but still we think that the Gymkhana on the whole is not popular. Beyond those who took an active part in the programme on Saturday, everyone seemed more or less bored, and this is sometimes the case at these meetings. With these introductory remarks we shall pass on to the events.
The first event was a Bending Raoe, competitors having to ride their ponies in and out a row of flags. There were numerous entries for this race, which was run in heats; and eventually Mr. Harold Carver won from Mr. Bartlett The Postillion Race which followed was an interesting event competitors having, to ride 900 yards leading a bareback pony, dismount, change the saddle to the other pony, and gallop back to the winning post leading the unsaddled pony. Mr. Trafford easily secured the verdict in this event A number of ladies and gentlemen took part in the Mathematical Race, and the first to pass the post was Mr. Bartlett, bat unfortunately his partner had made a mistake in the addition sum given her, and the prize went to Mrs. Williams, for whom Mr, A. A Carver rode.The Captivity Stakes and Motor Car Binding Race did not attract competitors, and had therefore to be abandoned. As a substitute there was a race for children,who were handicapped accord-ing to their aze and a close and pretty not ended in Master Briscoe securing the prize. Only two teams entered for the Lloyd Lindsay competition, one from the R. Berks. Regiment and the other a civilian team. The former, composed of Major Finch, Capt Bingley, Mr. Bassett, and Mr, Bartlett, won somewhat easily, their time being half a minute lees than the losers. The Apple Race produced considerable amusement and was eventually won by Mr. Bartlett, riding for Mrs. Macpherson-Grant. At the dose of the programme, a Hack Sonny was got up and produced five entries. It was well won by Mr. A. A. Carver. At the conclusion Baroness von Humboldt-Dachroeden kindly undertook to distribute the prizes to the various winners. The band of the 2nd Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment, as usual, furnished the music and added considerably to the enjoyment of the afternoon, which was, climatically, very pleasant.
